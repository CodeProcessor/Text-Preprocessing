neural network model have shown their promis opportun for multi-task learn , which focu on learn the share layer to extract the common and task-invari featur . howev , in most exist approach , the extract share featur are prone to be contamin by task-specif featur or the nois brought by other task . In thi paper , we propos an adversari multi-task learn framework , allevi the share and privat latent featur space from interf with each other . We conduct extens experi on 16 differ text classif task , which demonstr the benefit of our approach . besid , we show that the share knowledg learn by our propos model can be regard as off-the-shelf knowledg and easili transfer to new task . multi-task learn is an effect approach to improv the perform of a singl task with the help of other relat task . recent , neural-bas model for multi-task learn have becom veri popular , rang from comput vision ( misra et al. , 2016 ; zhang et al. , 2014 ) to natur languag process ( collobert andweston , 2008 ; luong et al. , 2015 ) , sinc they provid a conveni way of combin inform from multipl task . howev , most exist work on multi-task learn ( liu et al. , 2016c , b ) attempt to divid the featur of differ task into privat and share space , mere base on whether paramet of some compon should be share . As shown in figur 1- ( a ) , the gener shared-priv model introduc two featur space for ani task : one is use to store task-depend featur , the other is use to captur share featur . the major limit of thi framework is that the share featur space could contain some unnecessari task-specif featur , while some sharabl featur could also be mix in privat space , suffer from featur redund . take the follow two sentenc as exampl , which are extract from two differ sentiment classif task : movi review and babi product review . the infantil cart is simpl and easi to use . thi kind of humour is infantil and bore . the word �infantile� indic neg sentiment in movi task while it is neutral in babi task . howev , the gener shared-priv model could place the task-specif word �infantile� in a share space , leav potenti hazard for other task . addit , the capac of share space could also be wast by some unnecessari featur . To address thi problem , in thi paper we propos an adversari multi-task framework , in which the share and privat featur space are in herent disjoint by introduc orthogon constraints.specif , we design a gener share privat learn framework to model the text sequenc .
